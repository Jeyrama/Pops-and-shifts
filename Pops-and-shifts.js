/*
Sparse arrays in Javascript can be very useful, 
but just as often they can be be very annoying. 
One of the reasons is that sometimes basic array 
methods are not well suited for sparse arrays. 

For example, pop() method will try to return the 
last array element regardless of whether it exists or not. 
If it doesn't exist, the result is undefined. 
It's great if that's what you want, but what if you want to return the next existing element in a sparse array?

Your task here is to create a new pops() array method, 
which would pop the last existing element in the array 
and remove this element and any nonexisting ones after it. 

For example:
  array = [1,2,3,,,,]
  array.pops() // = 3
  array // = [1,2]

While you're at it, you could also create a new shifts() array method, 
which would do the same this from the other end of an array 
and mimic the basic shift() array method. 

For example:
  array = [,,,1,2,3]
  array.shifts() // = 1 
  array // = [2,3]
*/


// Solution

Array.prototype.pops = function () {
  return this.splice(Object.keys(this).pop())[0];
}

Array.prototype.shifts = function () {
  return this.splice(0, +Object.keys(this).concat(1/0)[0] + 1).pop();
}

// or

Array.prototype.pops = function() {
  if (this.length === 0) {
    return
  }
  while (this.length && !(this.length - 1 in this)) {
    this.pop()
  }
  return this.pop()
}

Array.prototype.shifts = function() {
  if (this.length === 0) {
    return
  }
  while (this.length && !(0 in this)) {
    this.shift()
  }
  return this.shift()
}
